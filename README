About the app:

http://www.de-corona-poll.nl (it is in Dutch)

A poll-app with corona-related questions, to collect data and show graphs based on that data.
For this app I used Express to create routes and query the database, for the front-end I used React to create static files, that can be found in the 'build' folder. It is hosted on DigitalOcean, using NginX as proxy server and PM2 as Process Manager.

How to run:

Edit the dbconfig and salt variables in /config/default.json. The dbconfig should be a MongoDB URI containing your username and password. The salt is used to encrypt the emailadres of a participant, and can be anything you want it to be, as long others don't get to see it.
After that, simply run 'node app.js' in the root folder.
